# Lunch-Randomiser
Sometimes I can't decide what to eat. I also need to practice programming without an IDE. Solution: Lunch Randomiser.

Pretty sure this is public so, whatever.

Lunches are recorded in a .txt called "lunches.txt".
Each line is a different lunch
Lunches take the format "<HEALTHY|WARM|NEW|TREAT> : <name of lunch>"

Do not clone if you, due to head trauma or other obstacles to what society considers "normal" cognition, expect this to change your life.

it chooses lunches.

randomly.

that's it.
