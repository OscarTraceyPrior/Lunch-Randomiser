# Lunch-Randomiser
Sometimes I can't decide what to eat. I also need to practice programming without an IDE. Solution: Lunch Randomiser.

Pretty sure this is public so, hello there my indecisive friend.

Lunches are recorded in a .txt called "lunches.txt".
Each new line is a different lunch
Lunches take the format "<HEALTHY|WARM|NEW|TREAT> : <name of lunch>"
No the case of "HEALTHY" etc. does not matter.

Please do not clone if you, due to head trauma or other obstacles to what society considers "normal" cognition, expect this to change your life.

it chooses lunches.

randomly.

badly.

that's it.
